# HackVault

This is a container repository for my public web hacks. For more information, please check the [Wiki](https://github.com/0xsobky/HackVault/wiki).
Ideally, it'd be continually updated with new interesting stuff over time.

It hadnt been updated anymore, please upload new payloads
## Interesting?

If you find the stuff in this repo pretty interesting and would like to see more research of the kind, you may consider passing some Bitcoin dust to this address: `12FyKqVqVxpFDSr6puHbDMyiNKtR7cQwDb`. Or this one if you prefer Ethereum: `0xC92E259a2572e0F5C9f912B3264617bf857e2A4F`.
